# MangaApplizer
- Simple Manga downloader with built in viewer.


## Based on:
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)
- `Materialize` for CSS
- [Hakuneko](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hakuneko) for Kissmanga source.

### Bugs that will be fixed in 1.0.0

- Source change between kissmanga and lhscans. `(Issue #24)`.
- Prev-Next button in viewer. Right now we are using wrap to fix this.
