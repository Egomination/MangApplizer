# MangaApplizer
- It does not mean anything. It's just a repo that we trying to improve our javascript
knowledge on electron.

#### Jokes aside
- It's a manga downloader/viewer! desktop application. We're too lazy to open an acutal web page
to read them.


## Based on:
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)
- `Materialize` for CSS
- [Hakuneko](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hakuneko) for Kissmanga source.

### Bugs that will be fixed in 1.0.0

- Source change between kissmanga and lhscans. `(Issue #24)`.
- Prev-Next button in viewer. Right now we are using wrap to fix this.
